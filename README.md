# Pet-feeder
Arduino based pet feeder

## 3D printed models

All printed using an Ender 3 pro and with the following settings
- Material: PLA+
- Nozzle Temp: 210 C
- Bed Temp: 60 C
- Print speed: 60 mm/s
- Slicer Settings: Use Standard default Cura settings (except printing temp and print speed)

## Funnel, Servo Bracket, and Food Chute
- Support Density: 10% for both
- Support placement for funnel: Touching buildplate
- Support placement for bracket: Everywhere
- Support placement for food chute: Touching buildplate
- Print bracket with front touching build plate for minimal support

** NOTE:** The food chute takes up the maximum amount of print surface from the Ender 3. If you plan on using 
a printer with a small bed size, the food chute will not fit. In order to get the chute to fit on the slicer, the bottom of the chute 
should be touching the build plate and oriented diagonally on the build surface. It takes a little messing around with, but You will eventually
get it set correctly.
