Arduino based pet feeder

## Libraries
Here are all the libraries you will need to download
https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button - Buttons library
https://github.com/VaSe7u/LiquidMenu - Creating the menu
https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib - Getting time from the RTC

## 3D Printed Models

All printed using an Ender 3 pro and with the following settings
- Material: PLA+
- Nozzle Temp: 210 C
- Bed Temp: 60 C
- Print speed: 60 mm/s
- Slicer Settings: Use Standard default Cura settings (except printing temp and print speed)

## Funnel, Servo Bracket, and Food Chute, and Chute Rail Supports
- Support Density: 10% for all
- Support placement for funnel: Touching buildplate
- Support placement for bracket: Everywhere
- Support placement for food chute: Touching buildplate
- Support placement for chute rail: Touching buildplate

## Model Orientation in slicer
- Print chute rail standing up with rear (closed off section) touching the build plate
- Print bracket with front touching build plate for minimal support

**NOTE:** The food chute takes up the maximum amount of print surface from the Ender 3. If you plan on using 
a printer with a smaller bed size, the food chute will not fit. In order to get the chute to fit on the slicer, the bottom of the chute 
should be touching the build plate and oriented diagonally on the build surface. It takes a little messing around with, but it will
eventually snap into place.
